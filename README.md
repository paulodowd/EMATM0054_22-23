# Robotic Systems: EMATM0054_22-23
Teaching Materials for Robotic Systems EMATM0054 AY 2022-2023

## Suggested Timeline

As a 20 Credit unit of study, you are expected to **invest 16 hours per week** to use the Core Labsheets to complete Assessment 1 Line Following Challenge.  For example, you could structure your time into two 8 hour days per week, or four 4 hour sessions of work.  **In general, it is recommended you focus for long blocks of time when learning to program a robot**.  It is likely you will fail Assessment 1 if you only work in the 2 hour laboratory sessions.  Use the laboratory sessions to discuss with the teaching staff problems and challenges that you have discovered during the week.

## Assessment 1 Solution

Core Labsheets are provided below, which will help you develop the core components of your solution for Assessment 1 Line Following Challenge.  However, you must integrate these core components into a final solution.  A block diagram is provided below to act as a guide, which will be discussed in the lecture sessions.  This block diagram illustrates the essential flow of information in the system, and how the system exhibits intelligent autonomous behaviour.

## Assessment 1 Video Example

The following video follows the assessment specification for recording the performance of your robot for Assessment 1.  In this video, the solution would achieve a final mark of 95%, by completing objectives 1-7, 8b & 9.

## Core Labsheets (Assessment 1)

It is recommended you read through all Labsheets before you start, and then decide on which areas you need to focus on.  If you have prior experience programming, there may be areas you can skip.  

You may wish to use the code template available on this <a href="https://github.com/paulodowd/EMATM0054_22-23/tree/main/3PI_CodeStub">github</a>, called `Labsheet_X`, and create copies replacing the X with the number of the labsheet you are currently working on.  This is the simplest way to keep versions of your code.
